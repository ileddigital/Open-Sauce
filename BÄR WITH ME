Stuff you'll need
A big saucepan
A fryingpan - cast iron skillet if you have it (get one if you don't - you can't cook propper stuff without one....) 
A blender (I prefer the hand blenders) 
Sauce bottles / jam jars
Spices you like - I used cumin, corriander and fennel seeds


Ingredients

Loads of dried chillies - any variety (I used a mix from India, Mexico, Italy and Spain) 
Dried mushrooms - get really good smelly ones.... I used around 25g) 
A big bunch of BÃ¤rlauch (wild garlic) 
A bulb of garlic (not a clove - the whole bulb - maybe 12 cloves) 
1/3 cup vinegar
1/3 cup sugar 
table spoon of salt
 

What do do...


Soak the  dried chillies and mushrooms in boiling water until soft - maybe 30mins
Get the frying pan hot - and then dry-fry the chillies and mushrooms until a little charred - don't be scared of the 
Heat the oven to 110C - and put the clean sauce bottles / jam jars in 
Put the chillies in a big heavy bottomed saucepan and add water to cover + maybe 2-3cm more. 
Bring to the boil. Them put on a simmer. 
Simmer for 30 mins
Add the wild garlic and the garlic cloves
Add the spices  
Simmer for another 30 mins
Everything should be soft now
Add the vinegar and sugar and salt
Simmer for 10 mins
Get some bread ready.... and a glass of water (you'll need this to cool your tounge!) 

Taste. What does it taste like? Play with adding vinegar/salt/sugar in combo here until you're really happy with the flavour.

NOTE - it will be much spicier now than it will end up being - it will become a lot milder over time... 

Right it should be good now. Blend it up. 
And use a funnel (I cut the bottom off to make it a bit wider) and funnel the hot sauce into the hotel bottles/jars
Add a lid


Ready right away OR better to leave over time... I like it after a couple of weeks. 
Once opened - keep in the fridge and eat within a couple of weeks or so....
