this was #2 open-sauce during the pandemic.  had it with middle-east Mezze... the cardamon was picked up when I was in Kerala with my friend babitha... 
and is particularly amazing... super aromatic... you might want to play with the ammount you use... but don't be shy... this is 
all about the cardamon. 

I've really taken up dried garlic that I get from a fabulous asian store in Dundee (https://www.matthewsfoods.co.uk/) it's so
good.... 

Small batch (jam jar) 

10 dried chillies
1/2 cup dried garlic
1/2 tea-spoon crushed cardamon seeds
1 tea-spoon corriander seeds
1/4 tea-spoon crushed allspice seeds
1/2 tea-spoon spannish paprika (has to be the real deal or forget it!) 
a few good grinds of pepper

salt - don't be shy this needs to be stored... and you're only having this in small ammounts


Put it all in a small saucepan with around 1 cup water. Bring to the boil then simmer for 30-60 minutes until all the ingredients are soft
Blend with a stick blender. Taste for salt/spice -> warning it's ALWAYS really chilli-hot when first made...tends to mellow over time. 

Steralise a jam jar by heating it (and lid) in oven for 10 mins at 120C.  Store in Jam Jar for ages.... but you won't as you'll eat the lot. 

Viel Spa√ü
