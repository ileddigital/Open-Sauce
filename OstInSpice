This is my first of pandemic sauces.... i really needed an open sauce to go with my attempts at Ramen, Fried Rice and all things 
eastern....  so here it is.. the kids think it's pretty good and it seems to work (we're getting through the first batch pretty quick

This isn't the usual red-colour.... more beige.. but don't be put off! 


made two jars full

1/2 cup dried chillies
1 cup dried garlic
1 bulb fresh garlic
2 star anise
2 teaspoons Szechaun peppers - or more if you're brave! 
1 tablespoon vinegar
salt (2 teaspoons or more - don't be shy it needs to preserve) 
sesame oil (make sure it's 100%) - i used a roasted one. 

Put all of the ingredients EXCEPT the sesame oil into a pan with 2 cups of water. bring to the boil and simmer 30-60 mins. 
add water if it's looking too dry during this. 
when everything is soft  REMOVE THE STAR ANISE and blend into a sauce. 

put in steralized jars (120C in oven for 10  mins) - and top off with sesame oil - around a CM thick).
