#Roasted Pineapple Scotch

A spicy, smoky hot sauce experiment written for the open sauce github project on 11th May 2020.

Makes a small jar, approx 200ml finished hot sauce.

##Ingredients
* 4 fresh scotch bonnet chillis
* 1 fresh thin green chilli
* 1/4 a pineapple (fresh or canned)
* 1/3 onion
* 1/3 carrot
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 tbsp lime juice
* 1 tsp jaggery (or sub sugar)
* 1/8 tsp smoked paprika
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/4 cup vinegar (I used apple cider)
* 1/2 cup water (or as needed to thicken to liking)


##Method

1. De-stem chillis (leave seeds in), peel carrot and roughly chop onion, pineapple & carrots. Place on baking tray and roast at around 180 degrees for 20ish minutes or until they caramelise and look a bit charred. Remove skin from garlic and onion if required.
2. Throw everything from step 1 into a blender - add lime juice, jaggery, smoked paprika, salt, vinegar and water.
3. Blitz to a chunky or smooth consistency as you like.
4. Taste and add extra water / vinegar / salt to your liking. You may want to wear swimming goggles when opening the blender for first time.
5. Transfer your sauce to a sterilised jar (see KardamonSinn recipe for sterilising instructions)
6. Leave in fridge and enjoy on everything.
7. Add suggestions for recipe as a commit to the open sauce repo on github!

#Enjoy!
