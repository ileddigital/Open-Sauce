[first seen and adapted from  here](https://dontwastethecrumbs.com/failproof-diy-homemade-mayo-in-2-minutes/) 

**ingredients**

1/2 juice lemon

1 egg

pinch of salt

1 cup sunflower oil (olive oil can be too bitter) 

**equipment**

Wide mouthed jar (like the one below) - has to be wide enough for the blender

A stick blender 

**method**


Put all of the ingredients in the jar. Leave to settle for 2 minutes so the oil is on top of the lemon juice and egg.  Slowly put your stick blender so the head is at the bottom of the har (you'll have it turned off). turn on the blender to full speed. it takes 40 seconds. mayo will form after 10-15 seconds. then slowly raise the stickblender so that all of the oil is converted to may. click the image below for a video... super simples.
